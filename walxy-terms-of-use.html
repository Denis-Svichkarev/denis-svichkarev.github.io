            <h2 id="location-health">Location and Health Data</h2>
            <p>To provide its core functionality, Walxy requires access to your location data and may request access to health-related data such as step count. By using the App, you consent to:</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> All watch data is processed locally on your devices and not transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy Limitations:</strong> Apple Watch sensors may be affected by fit, skin conditions, environmental factors, and device condition</li>

                <li><strong>Activity Detection:</strong> Health data helps distinguish walking from other activities like driving or cycling</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All HealthKit data is processed locally on your device and never transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li><strong>Permission Control:</strong> You can revoke HealthKit permissions at any time through your device's Health app settings</li>
