            <h2 id="information-collection">Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>By using Walxy, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Please read this policy carefully before you start using the App.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
            
            <h4>Personal Data</h4>
            <p>Walxy does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. Unlike many applications, I prioritize your privacy by ensuring that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal information such as names, email addresses, or account details are collected</li>
                <li>Any physical attributes (height, weight, gender) that you may input for fitness calculations are stored locally on your device only and are never transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>Device information (device model, operating system version) may be collected solely for diagnostic purposes but is anonymized and not linked to any personal identifiers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your privacy is my priority. The App functions without the need to create accounts or profiles, allowing you to enjoy its features without compromising your personal information.</p>

            <h2 id="location-data">Location Data</h2>
            <p>Walxy requires access to your location data to provide its core functionality. This is essential for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking your walks and routes</li>
                <li>Identifying sectors you have explored</li>
                <li>Calculating walking statistics</li>
                <li>Providing street names and sector information (requires internet connection)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important privacy note:</strong> Your location data and walking routes are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This information is not uploaded to any servers or shared with third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings, though this will limit the App's functionality. When you grant location permissions, you can choose between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"While Using the App" - Location is tracked only when Walxy is open and active</li>
                <li>"Always" - Enables background tracking features (recommended for accurate walk tracking)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="health-fitness">Health and Fitness Data</h2>
            <p>Walxy may request access to your device's motion and fitness sensors to track:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step count</li>
                <li>Walking cadence</li>
                <li>Elevation changes</li>
                <li>Activity type detection (to distinguish walking from driving/cycling)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data is used to calculate fitness metrics like calories burned and to determine your walking intensity. All health and fitness data is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processed locally on your device</li>
                <li>Not transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>Not shared with third parties</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can control access to health and fitness data through your device settings at any time.</p>

            <h2 id="apple-watch">Apple Watch Integration</h2>
            <p>When you connect an Apple Watch to enhance your Walxy experience, the following data may be collected and processed:</p>

            <h3>Apple Watch Data Collection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heart Rate Data:</strong> Real-time heart rate measurements for fat burning zone calculations</li>
                <li><strong>Activity Data:</strong> Workout information and activity metrics</li>
                <li><strong>Device Status:</strong> Watch connectivity and battery status for optimal performance</li>
                <li><strong>Sensor Data:</strong> Motion sensors for enhanced step counting and activity detection</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Apple Watch Privacy:</strong> All heart rate and watch data is processed locally on your devices (iPhone and Apple Watch) and is never transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Battery Usage Notice</h3>
            <p>Apple Watch integration may significantly increase battery consumption on both your iPhone and Apple Watch (up to double normal usage). This is due to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Continuous heart rate monitoring</li>
                <li>Real-time data synchronization between devices</li>
                <li>Enhanced GPS accuracy when both devices are active</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="healthkit">HealthKit Integration</h2>
            <p>Walxy integrates with Apple's HealthKit framework to provide enhanced fitness tracking capabilities:</p>

            <h3>HealthKit Data Access</h3>
            <p>With your permission, Walxy may access the following data from HealthKit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step Count:</strong> Daily and historical step data from your iPhone's Health app</li>
                <li><strong>Heart Rate:</strong> Heart rate data when Apple Watch is connected</li>
                <li><strong>Active Energy:</strong> Calories burned during activities</li>
                <li><strong>Walking Distance:</strong> Distance data for improved accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Workout Data:</strong> Walking and fitness session information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>HealthKit Data Usage</h3>
            <p>HealthKit data is used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide more accurate step counting and distance calculations</li>
                <li>Enhance calorie burn estimations based on your personal health profile</li>
                <li>Detect and prevent incorrect activity types (such as driving or cycling)</li>
                <li>Optimize fat burning zone recommendations</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Health Data Privacy:</strong> All HealthKit data remains on your device and is processed locally. Walxy never uploads health data to external servers. You can revoke HealthKit permissions at any time through your device's Health app settings.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="icloud">iCloud Backup and Sync</h2>
            <p>Walxy offers optional iCloud integration for data backup and synchronization across your devices:</p>

            <h3>iCloud Features</h3>
            <p>When you choose to enable iCloud backup, the following features are available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic Backup:</strong> Scheduled backups of your walking data to your personal iCloud account</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Backup:</strong> On-demand backup creation and restoration</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Device Sync:</strong> Synchronization of walking data between your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch</li>
                <li><strong>Data Recovery:</strong> Ability to restore your data when switching devices or reinstalling the app</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What's Backed Up to iCloud</h3>
            <p>When iCloud backup is enabled, the following data is stored in your personal iCloud account:</p>

            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>iCloud Privacy:</strong> Data backed up to iCloud is stored in your personal iCloud account and is subject to Apple's iCloud privacy policies. I do not have access to your iCloud data. You control when backups are created and can disable iCloud features at any time.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>iCloud Requirements</h3>
            <p>To use iCloud features:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage and Usage</h2>

                <li>iCloud backup data remains in your personal iCloud account until you delete it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diagnostic and Usage Data</h3>
            <p>To improve the App and fix technical issues, I collect limited diagnostic information:</p>

            <p>For this purpose, I utilize Apple's analytics frameworks, which may collect certain technical data from your device. No personally identifiable information, location data, or health data is obtained through this process.</p>

            <h2 id="safety">Safety and Responsibility Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Walxy encourages exploration and outdoor activity, but users are solely responsible for their personal safety. The App does not guarantee that all areas shown as explorable are safe or legally accessible. Users must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow local laws regarding access to areas</li>
                <li>Avoid dangerous locations such as industrial zones, construction sites, private property, or natural hazards</li>
                <li>Exercise common sense and prioritize personal safety over earning points or completing sectors</li>
                <li>Be aware that sector boundaries and accessibility information may not be complete or current</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As the App developer, I do not assume responsibility for your choice of walking routes or any accidents, injuries, or legal issues that may arise while using the App. Always use good judgment and be aware of your surroundings.</p>

            <h2 id="advertising">Advertising and Analytics</h2>
            <p>Walxy may display advertisements to support the free version of the App. These advertisements are delivered by third-party ad networks:</p>

            <h3>Personalized Advertising</h3>
            <p>The App may request your consent to show personalized advertisements. Important points to understand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All ad personalization is handled directly by third-party advertising networks (such as Google AdMob)</li>
                <li>I do not collect, store, or process any of your data for advertising purposes on my servers, as I do not operate any servers for this App</li>
                <li>Your consent for personalized ads is managed between your device and the ad networks directly</li>
                <li>Device identifiers (such as Apple's IDFA) may be used by advertising networks, but only with your explicit consent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You have control over personalized advertising through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consent choices presented within the App</li>
                <li>Your device's privacy settings (Limit Ad Tracking on iOS)</li>
                <li>Upgrading to the Premium version, which removes all advertisements</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your precise location data from walks and routes is stored only on your device and is never shared with advertisers or any third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ad Networks</h3>
            <p>This App uses Google AdMob for serving advertisements. Google AdMob operates under its own privacy policy, which you can review on their website. When you use the App:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google AdMob may collect certain device information to serve relevant ads</li>
                <li>This collection and processing is governed by Google's privacy policy</li>
                <li>I do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
            <p>Under GDPR and other privacy regulations, you have rights regarding your data. Since I do not collect or store your data on my servers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To manage advertising preferences, you can use the App settings or your device's privacy controls</li>
                <li>To withdraw consent for personalized ads, you can adjust your settings within the App or your device</li>
                <li>For concerns specifically about data collected by Google AdMob, you should consult Google's privacy policy and data controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="children">Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Walxy is intended for users 18 years of age or older. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. The app's activity tracking features and health recommendations are designed specifically for adult users.</p>

            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided personal data, please contact me so that I can take appropriate steps. Parents who allow minors to use the app are fully responsible for ensuring their safety during walking activities.</p>

            <h2 id="transfer">Transfer of Data</h2>
            <p>If you are located outside Italy and choose to provide information to me, please note that I transfer minimal technical data to Italy and process it there for diagnostic purposes only.</p>
            
            <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. I take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely.</p>

            <h2 id="gdpr">GDPR Compliance</h2>
            <p>As a user of Walxy, you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, it's important to understand that most traditional GDPR rights are automatically fulfilled by the App's unique privacy-first approach:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Since all personal data is stored locally on your device, you already have direct access to all your information through the App itself.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> All your data is on your device and not stored on external servers. You control the data on your device directly. iCloud backup data can be exported through the app's backup features.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Right to Deletion/Erasure:</strong> Uninstalling the App permanently removes all of your personal data from your device, effectively fulfilling this right. For iCloud data, you can delete backups through the app settings or your iCloud account.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> You can control data collection by adjusting permissions in your device settings at any time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The only data that might be transmitted outside your device is anonymous diagnostic and crash information that contains no personally identifiable information. This limited data processing is based on legitimate interests to improve App functionality and fix technical issues.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about your data rights or wish to raise a concern, please contact me at <a href="mailto:walxy.app@gmail.com">walxy.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="changes">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in my practices or legal requirements. When updates occur, I will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>

            <p>I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access Walxy to stay informed about how your information is protected. Your continued use of the Services after any modifications to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acknowledgment of the changes and your consent to abide by the updated terms.</p>
