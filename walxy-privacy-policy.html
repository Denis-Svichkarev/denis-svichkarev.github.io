            <h2 id="information-collection">Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>By using Walxy, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Please read this policy carefully before you start using the App.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
            
            <h4>Personal Data</h4>
            <p>Walxy does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. Unlike many applications, I prioritize your privacy by ensuring that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal information such as names, email addresses, or account details are collected</li>
                <li>Any physical attributes (height, weight, gender) that you may input for fitness calculations are stored locally on your device only and are never transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>Device information (device model, operating system version) may be collected solely for diagnostic purposes but is anonymized and not linked to any personal identifiers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your privacy is my priority. The App functions without the need to create accounts or profiles, allowing you to enjoy its features without compromising your personal information.</p>

            <h2 id="location-data">Location Data</h2>
            <p>Walxy requires access to your location data to provide its core functionality. This is essential for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking your walks and routes</li>
                <li>Identifying sectors you have explored</li>
                <li>Calculating walking statistics</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important privacy note:</strong> Your location data and walking routes are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This information is not uploaded to any servers or shared with third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings, though this will limit the App's functionality. When you grant location permissions, you can choose between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"While Using the App" - Location is tracked only when Walxy is open and active</li>
                <li>"Always" - Enables background tracking features (recommended for accurate walk tracking)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="health-fitness">Health and Fitness Data</h2>
            <p>Walxy may request access to your device's motion and fitness sensors to track:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step count</li>
                <li>Walking cadence</li>
                <li>Elevation changes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data is used to calculate fitness metrics like calories burned and to determine your walking intensity. All health and fitness data is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processed locally on your device</li>
                <li>Not transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>Not shared with third parties</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can control access to health and fitness data through your device settings at any time.</p>

            <h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage and Usage</h2>
            <p>It is important to understand that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal data, location history, walking routes, explored sectors, and fitness statistics are <strong>stored locally on your device only</strong></li>
                <li>This data is not uploaded to external servers</li>
                <li>When you delete the Walxy app, all your data is removed along with it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diagnostic and Usage Data</h3>
            <p>To improve the App and fix technical issues, I collect limited diagnostic information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>App performance metrics (crashes, hang-ups)</li>
                <li>Feature usage statistics (anonymized and aggregated)</li>
                <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For this purpose, I utilize Google Analytics, which may collect certain technical data from your device. No personally identifiable information or location data is obtained through this process.</p>

            <h2 id="safety">Safety and Responsibility Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Walxy encourages exploration and outdoor activity, but users are solely responsible for their personal safety. The App does not guarantee that all areas shown as explorable are safe or legally accessible. Users must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow local laws regarding access to areas</li>
                <li>Avoid dangerous locations such as industrial zones, construction sites, private property, or natural hazards</li>
                <li>Exercise common sense and prioritize personal safety over earning points or completing sectors</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As the App developer, I do not assume responsibility for your choice of walking routes or any accidents, injuries, or legal issues that may arise while using the App. Always use good judgment and be aware of your surroundings.</p>

            <h2 id="advertising">Advertising and Analytics</h2>
            <p>Walxy may display advertisements to support the free version of the App. These advertisements are delivered by third-party ad networks:</p>

            <h3>Personalized Advertising</h3>
            <p>The App may request your consent to show personalized advertisements. Important points to understand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All ad personalization is handled directly by third-party advertising networks (such as Google AdMob)</li>
                <li>I do not collect, store, or process any of your data for advertising purposes on my servers, as I do not operate any servers for this App</li>
                <li>Your consent for personalized ads is managed between your device and the ad networks directly</li>
                <li>Device identifiers (such as Apple's IDFA) may be used by advertising networks, but only with your explicit consent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You have control over personalized advertising through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consent choices presented within the App</li>
                <li>Your device's privacy settings (Limit Ad Tracking on iOS)</li>
                <li>Upgrading to the Premium version, which removes all advertisements</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your precise location data from walks and routes is stored only on your device and is never shared with advertisers or any third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ad Networks</h3>
            <p>This App uses Google AdMob for serving advertisements. Google AdMob operates under its own privacy policy, which you can review on their website. When you use the App:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google AdMob may collect certain device information to serve relevant ads</li>
                <li>This collection and processing is governed by Google's privacy policy</li>
                <li>I do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
            <p>Under GDPR and other privacy regulations, you have rights regarding your data. Since I do not collect or store your data on my servers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To manage advertising preferences, you can use the App settings or your device's privacy controls</li>
                <li>To withdraw consent for personalized ads, you can adjust your settings within the App or your device</li>
                <li>For concerns specifically about data collected by Google AdMob, you should consult Google's privacy policy and data controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="children">Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Walxy is intended for users 18 years of age or older. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided personal data, please contact me so that I can take appropriate steps.</p>

            <h2 id="transfer">Transfer of Data</h2>
            <p>If you are located outside Italy and choose to provide information to me, please note that I transfer minimal technical data to Italy and process it there for diagnostic purposes only.</p>
            
            <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. I take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely.</p>

            <h2 id="gdpr">GDPR Compliance</h2>
            <p>As a user of Walxy, you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, it's important to understand that most traditional GDPR rights are automatically fulfilled by the App's unique privacy-first approach:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Since all personal data is stored locally on your device, you already have direct access to all your information through the App itself.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> All your data is on your device and not stored on external servers. You control the data on your device directly.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Right to Deletion/Erasure:</strong> Uninstalling the App permanently removes all of your personal data, effectively fulfilling this right. No additional steps are needed to delete your data from external servers because your data is never stored there.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> You can control data collection by adjusting permissions in your device settings at any time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The only data that might be transmitted outside your device is anonymous diagnostic and crash information that contains no personally identifiable information. This limited data processing is based on legitimate interests to improve App functionality and fix technical issues.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about your data rights or wish to raise a concern, please contact me at <a href="mailto:walxy.app@gmail.com">walxy.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="changes">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in my practices or legal requirements. When updates occur, I will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>

            <p>I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access Walxy to stay informed about how your information is protected. Your continued use of the Services after any modifications to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acknowledgment of the changes and your consent to abide by the updated terms.</p>
